-- This was a really tricky plugin for me to figure out for some reason. For
-- starters, I was confused thinking it was used only for errors, warnings, and
-- other stuff like that, when in reality it's just a tool to show you popup
-- and other windows with lists of things. And then I didn't at all grasp from
-- reading the main page (or docs) that while the plugin has a fairly small and
-- well defined number of built-in "modes", from which you can "inherit" to 
-- define as many of your own customizations as you want.
--
-- For example, the built-in sources include diagnostics, fzf, a whole bunch of
-- lsp stuff defined programmatically (from an initial 'lsp_base' mode that isn't
-- actually available), qflist, loclist, telescope, and telescope_files. See
-- the mode definitions in the sources folder for more details on their default
-- configurations. Some of these differ only by groups of things to show, how
-- they're filtered, etc., and you can create your own based on these. I'll make
-- some other notes below to explain a bit more.
